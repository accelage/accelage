I am a CS graduate with a profound interest in creating a cybersafe world and a dedication to solving complex problems, I'm excited to leverage skills in information technology to launch a career in cybersecurity. Over time, I've developed a deep root understanding of complex systems and networks and my undying passion for cybersecurity has led me to actively pursue trainings, certifications and hands-on experience in this field.

I'm confident in my ability to research and quickly adapt to new technologies and trends, and I'm committed to ongoing learning and professional growth. My strengths include:

- Strong analytical and problem-solving skills
- Excellent communication and collaboration abilities
- Enthusiasm and growth mindset while managing time effevtively.
- Proficiency in Systems Engineering, Networking, Database, and Web development and how security should be the first thought.

I'm actively addressing areas for improvement, including transition from being a Genralist to a Specialist. I'm eager to bring my skills, enthusiasm, and strong work ethic to a forward-thinking organization dedicated to protecting sensitive information and staying ahead of emerging threats. Thank you for considering my application."

## Objective

My journey across different domains of computer science and engineering has led me to develop a strong passion for cybersecurity, knowing well that many organizations take security as an after thought over productivity and profitability, while neglecting the effect that an unprecedented or unplanned cyber attack could cause in brand reputation, regulatory fines and more. I am more than eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
